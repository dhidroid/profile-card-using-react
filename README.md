# React Flip Card UI

This project replicates a modern interactive business card with a 3D flip effect using React, styled-components, and framer-motion. The card includes a front side with a profile picture and a quote, and a back side with contact information and a QR code.

## Features

- **Interactive Flip Animation**: Smooth hover effects using `framer-motion` to rotate the card on hover.
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Support Button**: A button that opens the user's default email client when clicked.
- **QR Code**: Customizable QR code section.
- **Profile Picture and Contact Details**: The front side includes a profile image with a brief quote, and the back side displays contact details and a QR code.
